 *typed password* \<enter>
 
**Explanation**
 
My ieng6 username was 11 commands away due to my previous attempt, so I simply needed to press up to find and execute it. From there, I was able to type my password to finish Step 4 and log in

*typed "git clone"*
 
*clicked the copy button from my fork of lab7 from GitHub*
 
\<Ctrl+P>\<enter>
 
**Explanation**
 
For Step 5, I just felt like typing git clone was easier than looking for the command using the up method. Then, I just quickly grabbed the link to my GitHub lab7 repository to clone it. I pasted it using Ctrl+P into my terminal, and from  there I was able to run and clone my fork of lab7

**Explanation**
First, I typed "cd lab7", as it is a relatively short command and it brings me to the correct directory to access testListExamples.java and compile and run it. Then, with the sheer size and complexity of the compile and run commands in mind, I opted to use my command history and find my previous attempt's compile and run commands by pressing up 10 times for each. From there, I was able to demonstrate the failed test.
