**Lab Report 3**

For this lab, I will have chosen to study and research the "grep" command, as it seems the most appealing to me as it seems very useful in finding specific strings of texts in a large amount of files. 

To start, I went ahead and asked ChatGPT for a rundown on some grep command-line options!


I decided to pick "", "", "", and "" for this lab report! However, I would like to briefly state that each my command-line options for grep will start with "-rl", as it helps a lot with recursively searching through "./written_2" without explicitly needing to state a file, allowing me to search through the entirety of "./written_2" and its subdirectories rather than just searching through a singular file! 

**1. grep -rL"**
"grep -r --color [pattern]" is a command that will search through "./written_2" for files that contain the pattern, then print each file and its text one by one. However, using the "--color" option, the instances of the pattern will now be highlighted in a different color font, allowing for clear and easy access of where the pattern actually is in the files! Here are some examples:




Essentially, it makes searching for the exact instances of a pattern much easier! 



This command option proves itself to be very useful as it can filter out 

**2. grep "**

**"3. grep"**
**"4. grep "**
