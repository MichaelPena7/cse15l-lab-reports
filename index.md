**Lab Report 5**

Here, I will be expanding upon Lab Report 5 and explore how I went about speeding up the process in executing steps four through nine with a bash script that encompasses the general goal 
of steps four through nine.

First, I simply copied all the command lines I used into a bash script. At first, I wanted to create a bash file from my ieng6 account and thoroughly create one through their, however, I soon realized that it would have me have to constantly edit it with "nano". Deeming this as tedious, I decided to simply create a bash file called "test.sh" and simulate what I am meant to do before logging into my ieng6 account.

Here is all the commands I inputted into test.sh, which came directly from my Lab Report 4.
