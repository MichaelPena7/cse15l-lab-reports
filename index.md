 *typed git clone*
 
 *clicked the copy button from my fork of lab7 from GitHub*
 
 \<Ctrl+P>\<enter>
 
 **Explanation**
 
 For Step 5, I just felt like typing git clone was easier than looking for the command using the up method. Then, I just quickly grabbed the link to my GitHub lab7 repository to clone it. I pasted it using Ctrl+P into my terminal, and from  there I was able to run and clone my fork of lab7
